 

Ports for windows file sharing

Postby chicagotech » Sat Oct 18, 2008 9:41 am
It depends on the windows version and how you access sharing. Quoted from Microsoft:

The following ports are associated with file sharing and server message block (SMB) communications:
• Microsoft file sharing SMB: User Datagram Protocol (UDP) ports from 135 through 139 and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ports from 135 through 139.
• Direct-hosted SMB traffic without a network basic input/output system (NetBIOS): port 445 (TCP and UPD).

Distributed File System
The Distributed File System (DFS) integrates disparate file shares that are located across a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN) into a single logical namespace. The DFS service is required for Active Directory domain controllers to advertise the SYSVOL shared folder.

System service name: DfsApplication protocol Protocol Ports
NetBIOS Datagram Service UDP 138
NetBIOS Session Service TCP 139
LDAP Server TCP 389
LDAP Server UDP 389
SMB TCP 445
RPC TCP 135
Randomly allocated high TCP ports TCP random port number between 1024 - 65535*
